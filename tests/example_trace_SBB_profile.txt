STATIC Basic Block Profile

Showing ALL blocks and edges (option -a used)

Profile elements:
ID       = unique block identifier number
start    = address of block's starting instruction
#I       = number of instructions in the block
end      = address of block's ending instruction
#E       = number of times the block was executed
desc     = description of this block's ending instruction:
             - NB = Not a Branch (falls-thru every time)
             - UB = Unconditional Branch
             - CB = Conditional Branch
             - IJ = Indirect Jump (multiple targets)
[TID:#T] = list of this block's outgoing edges
TID      = Target ID, the ID of each edge's target block
#T       = number of times each edge was taken
(ft)     = this edge is a fall-thru to the next block
